CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and design web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements, such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, making websites visually appealing.

Inline CSS applies styles directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. It’s suitable for small, quick customizations but is not recommended for large-scale projects as it’s hard to maintain.

Internal CSS is written inside a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. It is used when you want to style a single HTML page without affecting others.

External CSS involves linking an external CSS file to the HTML document using a <link> tag. This is the best practice for larger projects as it keeps styles separate from content and allows you to reuse the same CSS across multiple pages
